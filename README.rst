libsparkcrypto - A cryptographic library implemented in SPARK 2014.
===================================================================

libsparkcrypto is a formally verified implementation of several widely used
cryptographic algorithms using the SPARK 2014 programming language and toolset
[1]_.  For the complete library proofs of the absence of run-time errors like
type range violations, division by zero and numerical overflows are available.
Some of its subprograms include proofs of partial correctness.

The distribution contains test cases for all implemented algorithms and a
benchmark to compare its performance with the OpenSSL library [2]_.

Development version
===================

The current development version of libsparkcrypto is available through its GIT
[3]_ repository: ``https://github.com/Componolit/libsparkcrypto.git``

A browsable version of the repository is also available here:
https://github.com/Componolit/libsparkcrypto

Building and installing
=======================

Required tools
--------------

To build and prove libsparkcrypto, the following tools are required:

- GNAT (recent Pro or FSF)
- SPARK 2014 (tested with Pro 19.0 and Community 2018)
- GNU make
- OpenSSL (for building the benchmark, tested with 1.1.1j)
- SPARKUnit [4]_ (for unit testing, tested with 0.1.0)

The primary development environments of libsparkcrypto are Debian (x86_64) and
Ubuntu (x86_64). Though the source and project files should be system
independent, the Makefiles assume a UNIXish system (cygwin seems to work).
Tools like ``mkdir``, ``uname``, ``tail`` and ``install`` must be present in
the systems search path.

Build process
-------------

To build libsparkcrypto, change to the source directory and type::

$ make

You can install the library to <destination>, by typing::

$ make DESTDIR=<destination> install

Supported systems
-----------------

libsparkcrypto was successfully built and tested on the following systems:

+------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------+
|operating system  | architecture |  toolchain                                    |
+==================+==============+===============================================+
|Debian 9          | x86_64       |  SPARK Pro 19.0, GNAT Pro 19.0                |
+------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------+
|Debian 9          | x86_64       |  GNAT Community 2018                          |
+------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------+

Please send bug reports and comments to Alexander Senier <senier@componolit.com>.

Using libsparkcrypto
====================

Examples for using libsparkcrypto can be found in the ``tests`` subdirectory.

A user of the library has to provide a shadow for the package ``Interfaces``
providing a type definition for at least ``Unsigned_8``, ``Unsigned_32`` and
``Unsigned_64``.

Extending libsparkcrypto
========================

You are welcome to extend libsparkcrypto according to the terms of the
simplified BSD license referenced above. Please obey the following rules when
contributing changes back to the project:

- Make sure no undischarged VCs remain.
- Make sure the code compiles in both modes MODE=release and MODE=debug.
- Provide reference to documents and test cases for the parts you implemented.
- Make sure you successfully ran the test suite (``make test``).
- Try to stay consistent with the current style of the source.
- If feasible, implement a benchmark for your code.
- Create a pull request on GitHub

The Directory structure of libsparkcrypto is as follows:

+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|directory      | content                                            |
+===============+====================================================+
|``src/shared`` | sources analyzed by SPARK and used by Ada compiler |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|``src/spark``  | sources only analyzed by SPARK                     |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|``src/ada``    | sources only used by Ada compiler                  |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+

The directories ``src/ada`` and ``src/shared`` have a sub-directory ``generic``,
which contains platform independent code. Furthermore, there are
feature-specific directories like ``little_endian`` and architecture-specific
directories like ``x86_64`` which are included to proof and build steps as
configured.

Configuration is performed automatically by the top-level ``Makefile`` and can be
altered by passing the following variables to ``make``:

+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|variable          | description                                                          |
+==================+======================================================================+

+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``MODE``          | Build mode (``release`` or ``debug``).                               |
+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``OPT``           | Optimization level to use (``s``, ``0``, ``1``, ``2`` or ``3``).     |
+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``SHARED``        | Build a shared library (``0``, ``1``).                               |
+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``RUNTIME``       | Runtime to build for (``native`` or ``zfp``).                        |
+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``NO_TESTS``      | Disable tests step.                                                  |
+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``NO_SPARK``      | Disable SPARK proof step.                                            |
+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

|``SPARKUNIT_DIR`` | Base directory of the SPARKUnit installation.                        |
+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``DESTDIR``       | Installation base directory.                                         |
